# C-Programming

## C Programming :
C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.
## Operators :
Main article: Operators in C and C++
C supports a rich set of operators, which are symbols used within an expression to specify the manipulations to be performed while evaluating that expression. C has operators for:

arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %

assignment: =

augmented assignment: +=,-=,*=,/=,%=,&=,|=,^=,<<=,>>=

bitwise logic: ~, &, |, ^

bitwise shifts: <<, >>

boolean logic: !, &&, ||

conditional evaluation: ? :

equality testing: ==, !=

calling functions: ( )

increment and decrement: ++, --

member selection: ., ->

object size: sizeof

order relations: <, <=, >, >=

reference and dereference: &, *, [ ]

sequencing: ,

subexpression grouping: ( )

type conversion: (typename)

C uses the operator = (used in mathematics to express equality) to indicate assignment, following the precedent of Fortran and PL/I, but unlike ALGOL and its derivatives. C uses the operator == to test for equality. The similarity between these two operators (assignment and equality) may result in the accidental use of one in place of the other, and in many cases, the mistake does not produce an error message (although some compilers produce warnings). For example, the conditional expression if (a == b + 1) might mistakenly be written as if (a = b + 1), which will be evaluated as true if a is not zero after the assignment.[26]

The C operator precedence is not always intuitive. For example, the operator == binds more tightly than (is executed prior to) the operators & (bitwise AND) and | (bitwise OR) in expressions such as x & 1 == 0, which must be written as (x & 1) == 0 if that is the coder's intent.
